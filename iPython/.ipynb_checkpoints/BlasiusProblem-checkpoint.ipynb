This effect should be captured with appropriate position and type of upper bondary condition. \n",

The outlet BCs is better captured the funtion of $f(\\eta)$ than wall BCs. This phenomena is explanied easy the displacement of y-direction of fluid particle for the outlet BCs. The contour plots shows that error of the velocity is much higher at wall BCs for upper. However, the upper BCs located sufficiency far away the plate, this reason wall BCs is acceptable with compared analytical solution.\n",

The linear upwind scheme is taken a one grid value and interpolated with using gradient of the scalar variable on to the face. The linear upwind scheme also dependen on the direction of the velocity similar to the upwind scheme.
